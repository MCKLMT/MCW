# Guide to contributing MCW package updates

Thank you for contributing to our MCW packages! This guide walks you through the MCW package update process, whether you are part of the regular package maintenance team or an external contributor.

## Fork the MCW repository

The first step is to fork the MCW repository if you have not already. If you have an existing fork, you will need to [synchronize it to the origin](#update-your-fork-with-upstream-changes), or original Microsoft MCW repository, before committing any changes. This ensures you are working from the latest changes.

To fork an MCW repository, perform the following steps:

1. Browse to the top-level MCW repository and locate the link to the MCW repository you wish to fork: <https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW>.

2. With the selected MCW repository open, click the **Fork** button on the upper-right. If you belong to one or more GitHub organizations, you will be prompted to select the account into which you wish to fork the repository. In most cases, select your own profile.

3. After a few moments, you will be redirected to your forked repository. You will see a link to the original Microsoft MCW repository from which this repository was forked.

4. Now that you have forked the MCW repository, you are ready to clone your fork and start making changes. You can find the clone path to your fork by clicking the **Clone or download** button on its home page.

   - **Note:** If you are making a small change, you may not need to clone the fork to your local machine. It is possible to edit the files in your fork through the GitHub UI, then submit a pull request.

## Update your fork with upstream changes

To update your existing fork with changes made to the Microsoft MCW repository, open a new command prompt and **navigate to your forked repository**.

Execute the following git commands to keep your fork up-to-date:

### Add remote from original repository in your forked repository

```git
git remote add upstream git://github.com/Microsoft/REPO-YOU-FORKED-FROM.git
```

```git
git fetch upstream
```

### Update your fork from original repository to keep up with changes

```git
git pull upstream master
```

### Push changes to your fork after updating local repository

```git
git push
```

## Create pull request

After you have made the necessary changes for the update and committed them to your fork, you will need to submit a pull request (PR), referencing the [GitHub issue](reviewers.md#create-a-new-issue-for-update) that was created by the stakeholder.

1. Navigate to your fork on GitHub.

2. You will see a message stating that this branch is x commits ahead of Microsoft:master. Select **Pull request** to the right of this message.

3. The "Comparing changes" page will show you the number of commits, files changed, and whether there are merge conflicts. Ensure your commits are included and click **Create pull request**.

4. In the "Open a pull request" page, enter a descriptive title for your PR, as well as comments asking for a review. Be sure to **reference the GitHub issue** that was [created by the stakeholder](reviewers.md#create-a-new-issue-for-update) requesting the update (if one exists). You can do this in the comments by typing a hashtag (#), which will display a list of issues in the parent repository.

5. Select **Create pull request**.

## Addressing review feedback

Reviewers will make comments on your PR and submit reviews on specific lines of your committed files. GitHub should automatically notify you when these actions occur, depending on your settings. In either case, it is your responsibility to monitor your PR for feedback and address any issues with comments and additional commits. Any commits you make to your fork will automatically be added to your PR while it is still open.

Here is an example of a review that was submitted by a reviewer, which appears on the **Conversation** tab of the pull review. This is where you can see all reviews and associated comments in one place:

In the screenshot below, the contributor has committed a new change after the review ("Changed VSTS to Azure DevOps"), and has added a comment to the review item to that effect. Select **Resolve conversation** in this case:

The update process completes when the stakeholder merges your pull request.
